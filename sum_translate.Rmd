The original materials are from the original studies on the orientation effects [@stanfield_effect_2001; @ZwaanRevisitingMentalSimulation2012]. In addition to the teams recruited the American participants, the other teams had to translated the original materials to the local languages. Translators conducted the translated materials in terms of [the PSA protocol](https://psysciacc.org/translation-process/).

If you will conduct the translations, you can download the [translation template](https://osf.io/gq7xd/) for your work. The target pictures are available at [here](https://osf.io/dwnb4/).
