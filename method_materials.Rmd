All the scripts for final data collection turn are available on this [OSF page](https://osf.io/e428p/). Check the directories **Materials -> js**. Download the script you require. 

You would extract the materials from OpenSesame GUI. As like the below figure.

```{r OS_GUI, fig.width=500, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="File pool browser on the right side show all the picture files. Probe sentences sheet are in the loop on the middle part. Experimenters could edit them directly."}

knitr::include_graphics("./includes/fig/OS_GUI.png")
```


### Sentences
