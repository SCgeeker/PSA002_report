```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
library(tidyverse)
library(data.table)
library(lubridate)
library(magrittr)
library(flextable)
library(lme4)

# Import multiple-bytes string in English system
Sys.setlocale("LC_ALL","English") 

```


(The analysis is under management. We will update this page at any time.)

According to the [preregistered plan](prereg.html), we conducted the intra-lab and inter-lab analysis as the below arrangements.

## Intra-lab analysis during data collection

We managed the [progress site](https://scgeeker.github.io/PSA002_log_site/index.html) and accumulated the sequential analysis by team.

## Inter-lab analysis after data collection 

1. Identify the outliers in each data set.

2. Meta analysis of orientation effects across lab

3. Estimate a general orientation effect 

"In the mixed-effect model, we treat the laboratory and language as random effects and the match advantage of object orientations as a fixed effect."

4. Analysis on imagery scores
